# simple-asm

A pipeline to assemble, filter, and scaffold genomes with HiFi + Hi-C reads. 

## Usage
Hardcoded paths are in the config file. Here's the easiest way to run this pipeline: 


```shell
# clone this repository

# fill and modify the `config_template` and rename it to `nextflow.config`

# run with nextflow
nextflow run main.nf
```
